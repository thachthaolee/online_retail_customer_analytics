# 🛍️ Online Retail II – Customer Analytics & Segmentation  

This project explores the **[Online Retail II dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/online-retail-ii-data-set-from-ml-repository?resource=download&select=Year+2010-2011.csv)**, which contains transactional data from a UK-based online store between **2010–2011**. The goal is to analyze customer purchasing behavior, build an interactive dashboard for insights, and implement **machine learning techniques** to segment customers into meaningful groups.
